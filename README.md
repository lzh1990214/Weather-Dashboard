# Weather-Dashboard

## Description

This project is to create a simple interactive application that allows a user to see the weather forecast for multiple cities, so that the user can plan a trip accordingly.

## Strategies

1. The user will see the current and future conditions for a city when the user type the city name in the input box and click search button.
2. The user will see the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the wind speed on both current weather and 5-day weather forecast dashboards.
3. City names & key words will be shown as buttons under the search bar.
4. The user can click the search history buttons below the search bar and see current and future conditions for that city.
5. When refresh the page, the search history buttons will be reset.
